History - GPL

Originally this was a comment
on “public domain” not being a valid status in some countries. However sqlite.org
charge USD6000 for “perpetual right-to-use for the SQLite source code”. These
two items alone are explicitly disallowed by the Open Source Initiative. In
addition the most important test harness is only available commercially, and so
is the only supported encryption code. These are not features of an open codebase.
Interestingly while we expected Oracle to close off MySQL as much as possible
without technically breaching the GPL, now MariaDB are also publishing as
much code as they can under their Business Source License, where “Power Users”
must pay. This includes cryptographic code and network scaling code. To make
the internet more robust we need to make sure that there is an open source
future for MySQL and MariaDB dialects as well as SQLite.

in perpetuity.
